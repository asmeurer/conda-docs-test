The 2MB Adobe Illustrator (.ai) :download:`conda cheat sheet <conda-cheat-sheet.ai>` is 
the source file used to build the pdf cheat sheet. We've moved it from Google Drive to 
the GitHub repository with the rest of the source files, and linked to it from this 
hidden file to be sure it's included in the build and produces no errors or warnings.

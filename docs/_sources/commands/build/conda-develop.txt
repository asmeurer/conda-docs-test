   NAME
          conda - conda develop
   
   DESCRIPTION
          usage:  conda-develop  [-h]  [-npf] [-b] [-c] [-u] [-n ENVIRONMENT | -p
          PATH]
   
                 PATH [PATH ...]
   
          Install a Python package in 'development mode'.
   
          This works by creating a conda.pth file in site-packages.
   
   OPTIONS
      positional arguments:
          PATH   Path to the source directory.
   
      optional arguments:
          -h, --help
                 Show this help message and exit.
   
          -npf, --no-pth-file
                 Relink compiled extension dependencies against  libraries  found
                 in current conda env. Do not add source to conda.pth.
   
          -b, --build_ext
                 Build  extensions  inplace,  invoking: python setup.py build_ext
                 --inplace; add to conda.pth; relink runtime libraries  to  envi‐
                 ronment's lib/.
   
          -c, --clean
                 Invoke  clean  on  setup.py:  python  setup.py  clean  use  with
                 build_ext to clean before building.
   
          -u, --uninstall
                 Removes package if installed in 'development mode'  by  deleting
                 path  from conda.pth file. Ignore other options - just uninstall
                 and exit
   
          -n ENVIRONMENT, --name ENVIRONMENT
                 Name of environment (in envs dirs).
   
          -p PATH, --prefix PATH
                 Full path to environment prefix (default: envs  dirs/build-envi‐
                 ronment).

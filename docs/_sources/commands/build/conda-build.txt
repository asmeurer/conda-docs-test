                 RECIPE_PATH [RECIPE_PATH ...]
   
          Tool for building conda packages. A conda package is a  binary  tarball
          containing system-level libraries, Python modules, executable programs,
          or other components. conda keeps track of dependencies between packages
          and platform specifics, making it simple to create working environments
          from different sets of packages.
   
      positional arguments:
          RECIPE_PATH
                 Path to recipe directory.
   
      optional arguments:
          -h, --help
                 Show this help message and exit.
   
          -V, --version
                 Show the conda-build version number and exit.
   
          -n, --no-source
                 When templating can't be completed, do not obtain the source  to
                 try fill in related template variables.
   
          --output
                 Output the conda package filename which would have been created
   
          --python PYTHON_VER
                 Set the Python version used by conda build. Can be passed multi‐
                 ple times to build against multiple versions. Can  be  'all'  to
                 build  against  all known versions (['2.6', '2.7', '3.3', '3.4',
                 '3.5'])
   
          --perl PERL_VER
                 Set the Perl version used by conda build. Can be passed multiple
                 times to build against multiple versions.
   
          --numpy NUMPY_VER
                 Set  the NumPy version used by conda build. Can be passed multi‐
                 ple times to build against multiple versions. Can  be  'all'  to
                 build  against  all known versions (['1.6', '1.7', '1.8', '1.9',
                 '1.10', '1.11'])
   
          --R R_VER
                 Set the R version used by conda build. Can  be  passed  multiple
                 times to build against multiple versions.
   
          --lua LUA_VER
                 Set  the  Lua version used by conda build. Can be passedmultiple
                 times to build against multiple versions (['all', '2.0',  '5.1',
                 '5.2', '5.3']).
   
          --check
                 Only check (validate) the recipe.
   
          --no-anaconda-upload
                 Do not ask to upload the package to anaconda.org.
   
          --no-include-recipe
                 Don't include the recipe inside the built package.
   
          -s, --source
                 Only obtain the source (but don't build).
   
          -t, --test
                 Test  package  (assumes  package  is already built).  RECIPE_DIR
                 argument can be either recipe directory, in  which  case  source
                 download  may be necessary to resolve packageversion, or path to
                 built package .tar.bz2 file, in which case no source  is  neces‐
                 sary.
   
          --no-test
                 Do not test the package.
   
          -b, --build-only
                 Only  run  the  build,  without  any post processing or testing.
                 Implies --no-test and --no-anaconda-upload.
   
          -p, --post
                 Run  the  post-build  logic.  Implies  --no-test  and   --noana‐
                 conda-upload.
   
          --skip-existing
                 Skip  recipes  for  which there already exists an existing build
                 (locally or in the channels).
   
          --keep-old-work
                 Keep any existing,  old  work  directory.  Useful  if  debugging
                 across callstacks involving multiple packages/recipes.
   
          --dirty
                 Do  not remove work directory or _build environment, to speed up
                 debugging. Does not apply patches or download source.
   
          -q, --quiet
                 do not display progress bar
   
          --token TOKEN
                 Token to pass through to anaconda upload
   
          --user USER
                 User/organization to upload packages to on anaconda.org
   
          --no-activate
                 do not display progress bar
   
          --debug
                 show debugging output from conda and conda-build
   
          -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                 Additional channel  to  search  for  packages.  These  are  URLs
                 searched  in  the  order  they  are given (including file:// for
                 local directories). Then, the defaults or channels from .condarc
                 are  searched (unless --override-channels is given). You can use
                 'defaults' to get the default packages for conda,  and  'system'
                 to  get  the  system  packages,  which  also takes .condarc into
                 account. You can also  use  any  name  and  the  .condarc  chan‐
                 nel_alias  value will be prepended. The default channel_alias is
                 http://conda.anaconda.org/.
   
          --override-channels
                 Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.

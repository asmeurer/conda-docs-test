   NAME
          conda - conda render
   
   DESCRIPTION
          usage: conda-render [-h] [-V] [-n] [--output] [--python PYTHON_VER]
   
          [--perl PERL_VER] [--numpy NUMPY_VER] [--R R_VER]
                 [--lua  LUA_VER]  [-c  CHANNEL]  [--override-channels] [-f FILE]
                 [--verbose] RECIPE_PATH
   
          Tool for building conda packages. A conda package is a  binary  tarball
          containing system-level libraries, Python modules, executable programs,
          or other components. conda keeps track of dependencies between packages
          and platform specifics, making it simple to create working environments
          from
   
                 different sets of packages.
   
   OPTIONS
      positional arguments:
          RECIPE_PATH
                 Path to recipe directory.
   
      optional arguments:
          -h, --help
                 Show this help message and exit.
   
          -V, --version
                 Show the conda-build version number and exit.
   
          -n, --no-source
                 When templating can't be completed, do not obtain the source  to
                 try fill in related template variables.
   
          --output
                 Output the conda package filename which would have been created
   
          --python PYTHON_VER
                 Set the Python version used by conda build. Can be passed multi‐
                 ple times to build against multiple versions. Can  be  'all'  to
                 build  against  all known versions (['2.6', '2.7', '3.3', '3.4',
                 '3.5'])
   
          --perl PERL_VER
                 Set the Perl version used by conda build. Can be passed multiple
                 times to build against multiple versions.
   
          --numpy NUMPY_VER
                 Set  the NumPy version used by conda build. Can be passed multi‐
                 ple times to build against multiple versions. Can  be  'all'  to
                 build  against  all known versions (['1.6', '1.7', '1.8', '1.9',
                 '1.10', '1.11'])
   
          --R R_VER
                 Set the R version used by conda build. Can  be  passed  multiple
                 times to build against multiple versions.
   
          --lua LUA_VER
                 Set  the  Lua version used by conda build. Can be passedmultiple
                 times to build against multiple versions (['all', '2.0',  '5.1',
                 '5.2', '5.3']).
   
          -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                 Additional  channel  to  search  for  packages.  These  are URLs
                 searched in the order they  are  given  (including  file://  for
                 local directories). Then, the defaults or channels from .condarc
                 are searched (unless --override-channels is given). You can  use
                 'defaults'  to  get the default packages for conda, and 'system'
                 to get the system  packages,  which  also  takes  .condarc  into
                 account.  You  can  also  use  any  name  and the .condarc chan‐
                 nel_alias value will be prepended. The default channel_alias  is
                 http://conda.anaconda.org/.
   
          --override-channels
                 Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.
   
          -f FILE, --file FILE
                 write  YAML to file, given as argument here. Overwrites existing
                 files.
   
          --verbose
                 Enable verbose output from download tools and progress updates

   NAME
          conda - conda inspect linkages
   
   DESCRIPTION
          usage: conda-inspect linkages [-h] [--untracked] [--show-files]
   
          [--groupby {package,dependency}] [--all]
                 [-n ENVIRONMENT | -p PATH] [packages [packages ...]]
   
          Investigates  linkages of binary libraries in a package (works in Linux
          and OS X). This is an advanced command to aid  building  packages  that
          link  against  C libraries. Aggregates the output of ldd (on Linux) and
          otool -L (on OS X) by dependent packages.  Useful  for  finding  broken
          links,  or  links  against  system libraries that ought to be dependent
          conda packages.
   
   OPTIONS
      positional arguments:
          packages
                 Conda packages to inspect.
   
      optional arguments:
          -h, --help
                 Show this help message and exit.
   
          --untracked
                 Inspect the untracked files in the environment. This  is  useful
                 when used in conjunction with conda build --build-only.
   
          --show-files
                 Show the files in the package that link to each library
   
          --groupby {package,dependency}
                 Attribute  to  group  by (default: package). Useful when used in
                 conjunction with --all.
   
          --all  Generate a report for all packages in the environment.
   
          -n ENVIRONMENT, --name ENVIRONMENT
                 Name of environment (in envs dirs).
   
          -p PATH, --prefix PATH
                 Full path to environment prefix (default: envs  dirs/build-envi‚Äê
                 ronment).

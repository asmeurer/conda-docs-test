   NAME
          conda - conda init
   
   DESCRIPTION
          usage: conda init [-h]
   
          Initialize  conda  into a regular environment (when conda was installed
          as a Python package, e.g. using pip). (DEPRECATED)
   
   OPTIONS
      optional arguments:
          -h, --help
                 Show this help message and exit.
   
          WARNING: conda init is deprecated. The recommended way  to  manage  pip
          installed  conda is to use pip to manage the root environment and conda
          to manage new conda environments.
   
          Note that pip installing conda is not the recommended way  for  setting
          up  your  system.  The recommended way for setting up a conda system is
          by installing Miniconda. See http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html.

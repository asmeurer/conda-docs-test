   NAME
          conda - conda remove
   
   DESCRIPTION
          usage: conda remove [-h] [-y] [--dry-run] [--json] [--all] [--features]
   
          [--force] [--no-pin] [-c CHANNEL] [--override-channels]
                 [-n   ENVIRONMENT   |   -p   PATH]  [-q]  [--no-use-index-cache]
                 [--use-index-cache]  [--use-local]   [--offline]   [package_name
                 [package_name ...]]
   
          Remove a list of packages from a specified conda environment.
   
          This  command  will  also remove any package that depends on any of the
          specified packages as well---unless a replacement can be found  without
          that  dependency.  If  you  wish  to  skip this dependency checking and
          remove just the requested packages, add the '--force' option. Note how‐
          ever  that  this  may  result in a broken environment, so use this with
          caution.
   
   OPTIONS
      positional arguments:
          package_name
                 Package names to remove from the environment.
   
      optional arguments:
          -h, --help
                 Show this help message and exit.
   
          -y, --yes
                 Do not ask for confirmation.
   
          --dry-run
                 Only display what would have been done.
   
          --json Report all output as json. Suitable for using conda programmati‐
                 cally.
   
          --all  Remove all packages, i.e., the entire environment.
   
          --features
                 Remove features (instead of packages).
   
          --force
                 Forces  removal  of  a  package  without  removing packages that
                 depend on it. Using this option will usually leave your environ‐
                 ment in a broken and inconsistent state.
   
          --no-pin
                 Ignore pinned file.
   
          -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                 Additional  channel  to  search  for  packages.  These  are URLs
                 searched in the order they  are  given  (including  file://  for
                 local directories). Then, the defaults or channels from .condarc
                 are searched (unless --override-channels is given). You can  use
                 'defaults'  to  get the default packages for conda, and 'system'
                 to get the system  packages,  which  also  takes  .condarc  into
                 account.  You  can  also  use  any  name  and the .condarc chan‐
                 nel_alias value will be prepended. The default channel_alias  is
                 http://conda.anaconda.org/.
   
          --override-channels
                 Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.
   
          -n ENVIRONMENT, --name ENVIRONMENT
                 Name of environment (in envs dirs).
   
          -p PATH, --prefix PATH
                 Full  path to environment prefix (default: envs dirs/build-envi‐
                 ronment).
   
          -q, --quiet
                 Do not display progress bar.
   
          --no-use-index-cache
                 Force fetching of channel index files.
   
          --use-index-cache
                 Use cache of channel index files.
   
          --use-local
                 Use locally built packages.
   
          --offline
                 Offline mode, don't connect to the Internet.

   NAME
          conda - conda search
   
   DESCRIPTION
          usage: conda search [-h] [-n ENVIRONMENT | -p PATH] [--canonical] [-f]
   
          [--names-only] [--use-index-cache] [-o]
                 [--platform  {win-32,win-64,osx-64,linux-32,linux-64}]  [--spec]
                 [--reverse-dependency]   [--offline]   [-c   CHANNEL]   [--over‐
                 ride-channels] [--json] [--use-local] [regex]
   
          Search  for  packages  and  display  their  information. The input is a
          Python regular expression.  To perform a search with  a  search  string
          that  starts  with  a  -, separate the search from the options with --,
          like 'conda search -- -h'.
   
          A * in the results means that package is installed in the current envi‐
          ronment.  A  . means that package is not installed but is cached in the
          pkgs directory.
   
   OPTIONS
      positional arguments:
          regex  Package specification or Python regular expression to search for
                 (default: display all packages).
   
      optional arguments:
          -h, --help
                 Show this help message and exit.
   
          -n ENVIRONMENT, --name ENVIRONMENT
                 Name of environment (in envs dirs).
   
          -p PATH, --prefix PATH
                 Full  path to environment prefix (default: envs dirs/build-envi‐
                 ronment).
   
          --canonical
                 Output canonical names of packages only.
   
          -f, --full-name
                 Only search for full name, ie. ^&lt;regex&gt;$.
   
          --names-only
                 Output only package names.
   
          --use-index-cache
                 Use cache of channel index files.
   
          -o, --outdated
                 Only display installed but outdated packages.
   
          --platform {win-32,win-64,osx-64,linux-32,linux-64}
                 Search the given platform. Should be  formatted  like  'osx-64',
                 'linux-32',  'win-64',  and  so on. The default is to search the
                 current platform.
   
          --spec Treat the regex argument  as  a  package  specification  instead
                 (package_name[=version[=build]]).
   
          --reverse-dependency
                 Perform  a  reverse dependency search. When using this flag, the
                 --full-name flag is recommended. Use 'conda info package' to see
                 the dependencies of a package.
   
          --offline
                 Offline mode, don't connect to the Internet.
   
          -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                 Additional  channel  to  search  for  packages.  These  are URLs
                 searched in the order they  are  given  (including  file://  for
                 local directories). Then, the defaults or channels from .condarc
                 are searched (unless --override-channels is given). You can  use
                 'defaults'  to  get the default packages for conda, and 'system'
                 to get the system  packages,  which  also  takes  .condarc  into
                 account.  You  can  also  use  any  name  and the .condarc chan‐
                 nel_alias value will be prepended. The default channel_alias  is
                 http://conda.anaconda.org/.
   
          --override-channels
                 Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.
   
          --json Report all output as json. Suitable for using conda programmati‐
                 cally.
   
          --use-local
                 Use locally built packages.
   
   EXAMPLES
          Search for packages with 'scikit' in the name:
   
                 conda search scikit
   
          Search for the 'python'  package  (but  no  other  packages  that  have
          'python' in the name):
   
                 conda search -f python
   
          Search  for  packages  for  64-bit Linux (by default, packages for your
          current platform are shown):
   
                 conda search --platform linux-64
